my first steps in machine learning world

## [tragedy_to_ml -> linear regression](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/tragedy_to_ml.ipynb)

In this code we created a model using the Titanic dataset. Our model predicts the probability of a person's survival.
## flowers_ml -> classification
In this code our classifier model predicts a flower with given values of a sepal length, width and petal length, witdh.
## hello_world_ml
In this code neural network tries to determine the handwritten number.
## linear_function_ml
In this code one node tweaks its weight and bias that it founds the given linear function as y=mx+n

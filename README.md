# machine_learning
my first steps in machine learning world

## [tragedy_to_ml -> linear regression](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/tragedy_to_ml.ipynb)

In this code we created a model using the Titanic dataset. Our model predicts the probability of a person's survival.
## [flowers_ml -> classification](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/flowers_ml.ipynb)
In this code our classifier model predicts a flower with given values of a sepal length, width and petal length, witdh.
## [hello_world_ml](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/hello_world_ml.ipynb)
In this code neural network tries to determine the handwritten number.
## [linear_function_ml](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/linear_function_ml.py)
In this code one node tweaks its weight and bias that it founds the given linear function as y=mx+n

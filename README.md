# machine_learning
my first steps in machine learning world

## [tragedy_to_ml -> linear regression](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/tragedy_to_ml.ipynb)
In this code, we created a model using the Titanic dataset. Our model predicts the probability of a person's survival.
## [flowers_ml -> classification](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/flowers_ml.ipynb)
In this code, our classifier model predicts a flower with given values of a sepal length, width, and petal length, width.
## [hello_world_ml](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/hello_world_ml.ipynb)
In this code neural network tries to determine the handwritten number.
## [linear_function_ml](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/linear_function_ml.py)
In this code, one node tweaks its weight and bias that it founds the given linear function as y=mx+n 
## [convolutional_neural_network](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/convolutional_neural_network.ipynb)
This code classified ten daily objects using convolutional neural networks CNN for short. Essentially what CNN does is it determines features out of filters which gives us the ability to use our model for more general situations.
## [hidden_markov_model](https://github.com/SemihAkkoc/machine_learning/blob/main/hidden_markov_model.ipynb)
In this piece of code, we used the hidden Markov model.
